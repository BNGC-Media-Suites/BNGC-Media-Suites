- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BNGC-Media-Suites
Media Suites is a program available at Boys & Girls Club: Challengers that exposes kids to Computer, Visual and Audio technology.
3 subjects across 3 levels with 3 units with 3 lessons plus the Network program that creates, aggregates and promotes student content
to be available for streaming. 

GitHub is a resource for coding and stuff but in addition to exposing kids to this resource we'll be uploading projects and images from
the Kidernet (tm).
